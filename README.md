- Hi, I’m @WaltMenke
- I’m interested in utilizing Matlab and Python to help understand the biomechanics of humans and animals!
- I’m currently learning the basics of Python in the hopes of utilizing machine learning and advanced statistical analysis techniques to help with my PhD work. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on graphical user interface projects involving biomechanics (likely batch processing or biofeedback).
- How to reach me (wmenke@vols.utk.edu)
