- 👋 Hi, I’m @WaltMenke
- 👀 I’m interested in utilizing Matlab and Python to help understand the biomechanics of humans and animals!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Python in the hopes of utilizing machine learning and advanced statistical analysis techniques to help with my PhD work. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on graphical user interface projects involving biomechanics (likely batch processing or biofeedback).
